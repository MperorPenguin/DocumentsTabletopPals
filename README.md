# Tabletop Pals — DM Lite v2

**Adds back the Board** (2D grid + tokens + movement + scene upload), **Terrain intelligence** (adv/dis hints), and the **full Character Builder** with icon picker — while keeping the Netflix-style home.

## Highlights
- **Board**: click token to select, click grid to move; upload a scene background.
- **Terrain**: choose terrain and see advantage/disadvantage hints based on party/enemy tags.
- **Characters**: structured builder (class/race/background/alignment/level), ability dropdowns, armor/movement/wants, icon picker.
- **NPCs/Enemies**: quick lists, portraits (NPC) and icons (Enemy).
- **Dice**: animated d20 and custom expressions + log.
- **Dialogue**: choose speaker, quick prompts, log.
- **Notes & Save**: autosave to localStorage, export/import JSON.
